# Beam-WebPanel

This is is a web UI for my another project - Beam.

This UI serves as a personal web-panel - a representation and interactive view of user's personal web pages collection. 
It looks like different speed-dials or express-panels in browsers and was inspired by a good-old Opera 12 express-panel.

Used technologies - React.JS, jQuery UI Sortable widget, react-modal, a lot of css.
Backend - REST-like service written in Java.
