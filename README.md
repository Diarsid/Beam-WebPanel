# Beam-WebPanel

This is is a web UI for another my project - Beam.

This UI serves as a personal web-panel - a representation and interactive view of user's personal web pages set.
It is similar to different speed-dials or express-panels in browsers and was inspired by a good-old Opera 12 express-panel.

Used technologies - React.JS, AJAX, jQuery UI Sortable widget, react-modal, lodash, a lot of css.
Backend - REST-like service written in Java (not included in this project).
